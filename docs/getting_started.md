# Getting started

## Installation

### Recommended installation

The following installation procedure is recommended, because it ensures best performance. For example, the numpy, pandas and cvxpy packages are installed through Anaconda, which ensures the use of more performant math libraries.

1. Check requirements:
   - [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
   - [Gurobi Optimizer](http://www.gurobi.com/) or [CPLEX Optimizer](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer)
2. Clone or download repository. Ensure that the `cobmo` submodule directory is loaded as well.
3. In Anaconda Prompt, run:
   1. `conda create -n cobmo -c conda-forge python=3.9 cvxpy numpy pandas`
   2. `conda activate cobmo`
   3. `pip install -v -e path_to_repository`
4. If you want to use CPLEX:
   1. Install CPLEX Python interface (see latest CPLEX documentation).
   2. Create or modify `config.yml` (see below in "Configuration with `config.yml`").

### Quick installation

1. Check requirements:
   - Python 3.9
   - [Gurobi Optimizer](http://www.gurobi.com/)
2. Clone or download repository. Ensure that the `cobmo` submodule directory is loaded as well.
3. In your Python environment, run:
   1. `pip install -v -e path_to_repository`

### Alternative installation

If you are running into errors when installing or running CoBMo, this may be due to incompatibility with new versions of package dependencies, which have yet to be discovered and fixed. As a workaround, try installing CoBMo in an tested Anaconda environment via the the provided `environment.yml`, which represents the latest Anaconda Python environment in which CoBMo was tested and is expected to work.

1. Check requirements:
    - Windows 10
    - [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (Python 3.x version)
    - [Gurobi Optimizer](http://www.gurobi.com/)
2. Clone or download repository.
4. In Anaconda Prompt, run `conda env create -f path_to_cobmo_repository/environment.yml`
5. Once the environment setup finished, run `conda activate cobmo` and `pip install -e path_to_cobmo_repository`.

``` important::
    Please also create an issue on Github if you run into problems with the normal installation procedure.
```

## Examples

The `examples` directory contains run scripts which demonstrate the usage of CoBMo.

- `run_simulation_problem.py`: Example run script to demonstrate setting up and solving a simulation problem for building operation with CoBMo.
- `run_optimization_problem.py`: Example run script to demonstrate setting up and solving an optimization problem for building operation with CoBMo.
- The directory `examples/development` contains example scripts which are under development and scripts related to the development of new features for CoBMo.

## Configuration with `config.yml`

CoBMo configuration parameters (e.g. the output format of plots) can be set in `config.yml`. As an initial user, you most likely will not need to modify the configuration.

If you want to change the configuration, you can create or modify `config.yml` in the CoBMo repository main directory. CoBMo will automatically create `config.yml` if it does not exist. Initially, `config.yml` will be empty. You can copy configuration parameters from `cobmo/config_default.yml` to `config.yml` and modify their value to define your local configuration. To define nested configuration parameters, you need to replicate the nested structure in `config.yml`. For example, to define CPLEX as the optimization solver, use:

```
optimization:
  solver_name: cplex
```

The configuration parameters which are defined in `config.yml` will take precedence over those defined in `cobmo/config_default.yml`. If you would like to revert a parameter to its default value, just delete the parameter from `config.yml`. Please do not modify `cobmo/config_default.yml` directly.
