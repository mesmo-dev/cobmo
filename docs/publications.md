## Citing CoBMo

The recommended way to cite CoBMo is to refer to its latest [Zenodo record](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3523539). For example, you may use the following bibtex entry for version 0.3.0:

```
@misc{cobmo,
author = {Sebastian Troitzsch and Tommaso Miori and Anthony Vautrin},
title = {{CoBMo - Control-oriented Building Model}},
year = 2019,
howpublished = {Version 0.3.0, Zenodo},
doi = {10.5281/zenodo.3523539},
url = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3523539}
}
```

## CoBMo-enabled papers

The following papers have been prepared with CoBMo:

- [Preprint] Troitzsch, S., & Hamacher, T., **Control-oriented Thermal Building Modelling**, in IEEE PES General Meeting, Montreal, Canada, 2020. [`doi:10.36227/techrxiv.11923587`](https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.11923587)
    - CoBMo [version 0.3.0](https://github.com/TUMCREATE-ESTL/cobmo/releases/tag/0.3.0) was used to prepare the results for this paper.
