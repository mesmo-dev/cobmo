CoBMo scenarios are defined through CSV files, where each CSV file represents a table as defined below (the file name is interpreted as the table name). Internally, CoBMo loads all CSV files into a local SQLITE database for more convenient processing. The default location for CoBMo scenario definitions is in the `data` directory in the repository and all CSV files in the `data` directory are automatically loaded into the database. The CSV files may be structured into sub-directories, but all files are eventually combined into the same database. Hence, all type / element identifiers must be unique across all scenario definitions.
